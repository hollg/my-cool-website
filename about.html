            <h2>About the Department of Administrative Services</h2>
            
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) exists to provide comprehensive administrative 
                support to federal agencies, ensuring efficient government operations while maintaining the 
                highest standards of public accountability and fiscal responsibility.
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Founded in 1947 under Executive Order 9877, the Department of Administrative Services was 
                established in the post-war era to consolidate and streamline administrative functions across 
                the federal government. Over the past seven decades, DAS has evolved to meet the changing 
                needs of modern government while maintaining its core commitment to efficiency and service 
                excellence.
            </p>

            <h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
            <p>
                DAS is organized into five principal divisions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Office of Procurement and Acquisition Services</li>
                <li>Division of Facilities Management and Operations</li>
                <li>Human Resources Coordination Bureau</li>
                <li>Inter-Agency Liaison Office</li>
                <li>Administrative Policy and Compliance Division</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <p>
                The Department is led by the Director of Administrative Services, who reports directly to 
                the Office of Management and Budget. The current director is appointed by the President and 
                confirmed by the Senate.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                Since its inception, DAS has achieved numerous milestones in government efficiency, including 
                the implementation of standardized procurement procedures (1952), the establishment of the 
                Federal Administrative Database System (1989), and the successful digitization of inter-agency 
                coordination processes (2015).
